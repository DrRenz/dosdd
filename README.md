# dosdd
DOS Disk Dump (dosdd) is a set of tools to create and transfer block-based disk images of old x86-based PCs.

## Background
The lack of free and open source disk imaging tools for x86 PCs running DOS has prompted the creation of this project. It aims to be a universal set of tools to create and transfer block-based disk images to either directly attached drives or other PCs connected by a serial or parallel connection.

## Technology
The main toolkit is split into two parts:
- The imaging program running on the PC to be imaged.
- Optional: The receiver program running on another PC writing the image to its mass storage in raw format.

## Installation
TBD
